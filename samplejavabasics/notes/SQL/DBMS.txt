Data 
    It is raw, unprocessed facts that by themselves do not convey meaning.
    Without overriding toString() - Employee@6d06d69c <Just for understanding purpose, added this example>
Information 
    It is processed, organized, and contextualized data that has meaning and can be used for decision-making.
    With overridden toString() - Employee{id=101, name='Sam', salary=50000}
All information is data, but not all data is information.

The term schema is used in two ways: 
    one refers to the logical design of tables and relationships, and the 
    other refers to a SQL namespace that groups database objects. 
The context determines the meaning.

• A schema is a logical namespace that groups database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and procedures.
  Used in Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL (standard)
• A schema is the blueprint or structural design that defines tables, fields, relationships, and constraints.
  Referred as Table definitions, ER diagrams, Column data types, Foreign keys, Constraints

Design schema   → what the data looks like
SQL schema      → where the data lives

DBMS is the engine
Database is the container
Connection is session between client and DB
Schema is the folder/namespace
Table is the structure
Row is the data

Database
    A database is an organized, persistent collection of data, managed by a DBMS, stored on disk, and accessed using queries.
DBMS
    A database is a collection of data, and a DBMS is the software system that allows us to store, retrieve, update, delete, and manage that data safely and efficiently.
Data lake
    A data lake is a centralized storage system that holds raw data in its original format, from many sources, at large scale, primarily for future processing, analytics, and machine learning.
Data Warehouse
    A data warehouse is a centralized system designed to store historical, integrated, read-optimized data from multiple sources for analytics and reporting, not for day-to-day transactions.
Data Models
    A data model defines how data is logically stored, organized, and related in a database. It’s like the blueprint for your data.

OLTP
    OLTP systems handle day-to-day transactional operations with fast, simple queries.
    Databases were used commonly for OLTP.
OLAP
    OLAP systems support analytical queries over large volumes of historical data. (might have combined different table data)
    Data warehouses were used commonly for OLAP.

File-based system
    A file-based system stores data in files directly managed by the application.
    Example: Java app writes data to: .txt, .csv, .dat, .json

Advantages of DBMS
    Reduced data redundancy
    Data consistency
    Concurrency control
    Security
    Backup & recovery
    Data abstraction
Disadvantages of DBMS
    Complexity
    Cost
    Performance overhead
    Single point of failure
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************

ER Modeling
    ER (Entity-Relationship) modeling is a conceptual way to represent data, their attributes, and relationships before implementing in a database. It helps visualize and design databases logically.

Entities and Entity Sets
    Entity      - A real-world object or thing. Has a unique identity
    Entity Set  - A collection of similar entities

Attributes
    Attributes describe properties of entities.
        | Type        | Meaning                          | Example                                 |
        | ----------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
        | Simple      | Single-valued, atomic            | `name`, `age`                           |
        | Composite   | Can be broken down               | `full_name` → `first_name`, `last_name` |
        | Multivalued | Multiple values allowed          | `phone_numbers`                         |
        | Derived     | Calculated from other attributes | `age` from `dob`                        |

Keys
    refer other file in this folder

Relationship        - Association between two or more entities. Can have attributes too.
Relationship Set    - Collection of similar relationships

ER Diagrams
    Symbols (standard)
        Rectangle → Entity
        Oval → Attribute
        Diamond → Relationship
        Double Oval → Multivalued attribute
        Dashed Oval → Derived attribute
        Double Rectangle → Weak entity
        Lines → Connect entities to relationships or attributes
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************

ACID
    | Property    | Meaning         |
    | ----------- | --------------- |
    | Atomicity   | All or nothing  |
    | Consistency | Valid state     |
    | Isolation   | No interference |
    | Durability  | Permanent       |

BASE
    | Property             | Meaning          |
    | -------------------- | ---------------- |
    | Basically Available  | System stays up  |
    | Soft state           | Data may change  |
    | Eventual consistency | Consistent later |

DBMS
    Generic term
    Manages databases
    May not enforce relations

RDBMS
    Based on relational model
    Uses tables & keys
    Enforces ACID
    Uses SQL

Examples:
    MySQL
    PostgreSQL
    Oracle

NoSQL
    Non-relational
    Schema-flexible
    Horizontally scalable
    BASE-oriented

Types:
    Key–Value (Redis)
    Document (MongoDB)
    Column-family (Cassandra)
    Graph (Neo4j)

| Feature  | RDBMS        | NoSQL                 |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Schema   | Fixed        | Flexible              |
| Scaling  | Vertical     | Horizontal            |
| ACID     | Yes          | Partial / No          |
| Joins    | Supported    | Limited               |
| Use case | Transactions | Big data, distributed |

SQL
    SQL databases store structured and related data in tables with a fixed format, so relationships and data consistency are strictly enforced. They are used when accuracy and clear data relationships matter most.
NoSQL
    NoSQL databases store data in a more flexible way and follow the BASE approach, meaning they stay available and fast even if data becomes consistent a bit later. They are used when systems need to scale big and change often.

Single-Tenant Architecture
    Each customer gets their own dedicated application instance.

Multi-tenant means:
    One running application instance serves multiple customers (tenants).
    Example types:
        Master DB (Tenant Registry)
        Request → tenant → master DB → tenant DBs

        Config Server (No Master DB)
        Request → tenant → config service → tenant DBs

        Environment-Based Routing (Limited use)
        App_A → DB_A, DB_B 
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************

SQL commands are grouped into 5 main categories:
    DDL – Data Definition Language
    DML – Data Manipulation Language
    DQL – Data Query Language
    TCL – Transaction Control Language
    DCL – Data Control Language

Data Definition Language
    Define or change the structure of the database.
    “Database structure” means the database schema, which includes:
        Tables, Columns, Data types, Constraints, Indexes, Views, Sequences,Schemas (namespaces)
    Commands: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME

Data Manipulation Language
    Insert, update, delete data
    Commands: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE (DB-specific)

Data Query Language
    Read data
    Commands: SELECT

Transaction Control Language
    Control transactions
    Commands: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, SET TRANSACTION

Data Control Language
    Control access and permissions
    Commands: GRANT, REVOKE
