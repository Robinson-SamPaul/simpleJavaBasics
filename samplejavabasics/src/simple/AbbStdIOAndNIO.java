/*
Standard I/O (stdio)
	Byte-Oriented:
		Standard I/O operates on byte streams (InputStream and OutputStream).
		Input operations are performed using classes like InputStreamReader and BufferedReader.
		Output operations are performed using classes like OutputStreamWriter and BufferedWriter.
	Blocking I/O:
		Standard I/O operations are blocking, meaning they wait until the entire operation (e.g., read or write) 
		is completed before returning control to the program.
		Blocking I/O can lead to performance issues in applications with many concurrent I/O operations.
	Synchronous:
		In standard I/O, I/O operations are synchronous, which means they are executed sequentially, one after another.
	Character-Oriented:
		Standard I/O is primarily character-oriented, focusing on reading and writing characters rather than binary data.
		Classes like Reader and Writer are commonly used for character-based I/O.
	Buffering:
		Standard I/O often requires explicit buffering using classes like BufferedReader and BufferedWriter to improve I/O performance.
New I/O (NIO)
	Buffer-Oriented:
		NIO operates on buffer-oriented channels (Channel and Buffer).
		Input operations are performed using classes like ReadableByteChannel and Selector.
		Output operations are performed using classes like WritableByteChannel and Selector.
	Non-Blocking I/O:
		NIO offers non-blocking I/O operations, allowing multiple I/O operations to be initiated and managed asynchronously.
		Non-blocking I/O is more suitable for high-performance applications that require handling multiple connections simultaneously.
	Asynchronous:
		NIO supports asynchronous I/O operations, where I/O operations can be initiated and completed independently of the main program flow.
	Buffer Management:
		NIO provides built-in buffer management using classes like ByteBuffer and CharBuffer, making it efficient for handling large amounts of data.
	Channel-Based:
		NIO is channel-based, where data is transferred through channels, providing more control and flexibility over I/O operations.
